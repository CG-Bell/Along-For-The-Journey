Today I learned the basics of creating a class, method, string, and printing it. The code is written below:

public class Hello {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

**This was the result**

"C:\Program Files\Amazon Corretto\jdk11.0.15_9\bin\java.exe" "-javaagent:C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.1.2\lib\idea_rt.jar=64569:C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.1.2\bin" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath C:\Users\Administrator\IdeaProjects\HelloWorld\out\production\HelloWorld Hello
Hello World

Process finished with exit code 0

Key to remember that formatting is really important i.e. we have to take into account if a letter is capitalized, a space is between a word, correct symbols used etc.

I am using the program IntelliJ IDEA to learn programming. It was recommended by the coding instructor Tim Buchalka in the coding lesson series I'm using.
