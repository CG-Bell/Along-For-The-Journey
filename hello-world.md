# Java type program

Today I learned the basics of creating a class, method, string, and printing it. The code is written below:

```
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
**This was the result**
Hello World

Key to remember that formatting is really important i.e. we have to take into account if a letter is capitalized, a space is between a word, correct symbols used etc.

I am using the program IntelliJ IDEA to learn programming. It was recommended by the coding instructor Tim Buchalka in the coding lesson series I'm using.
